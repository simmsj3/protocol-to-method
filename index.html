        <h2>1. Use Third-Person Past Tense</h2>
        <div class="definition">
            <h3>What is Third-Person Past Tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Third-person past tense refers to a writing style that describes actions or events that have already occurred, using pronouns such as "it," "he," "she," "they," or the names of people or things, rather than "I" or "we."</p>
            <p><strong>Guidance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use "was" or "were" instead of "is" or "are"</li>
                <li>Avoid personal pronouns like "I," "we," or "you"</li>
                <li>Focus on what happened, not who did it</li>
                <li>Use passive voice when the doer of the action is not important</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Examples:</li>
            <li class="example">"The experiment was conducted..." (not "We conducted...")</li>
            <li class="example">"Spider plant cuttings were planted..." (not "Plant the cuttings...")</li>
